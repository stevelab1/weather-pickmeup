## About

Have you ever felt down when there's really bad weather outside?
</br>
Or really felt like jumping around and celebrating during summertime?
</br>
This application is an ode to all people with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) out there. We're with you ‚ù§.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

1. Git
1. A fork of the repo (for any contributions)
1. A clone of the [weather-pickmeup](https://github.com/stevelab1/weather-pickmeup) repo on your local machine
## Contributing Guidelines

### Create a branch

1. `git checkout main` from within your local `weather-pickmeup` repository
1. `git pull origin main` to ensure you have the latest main code
1. `git checkout -b the-name-of-my-branch` (replacing `the-name-of-my-branch` with a suitable name) to create a branch

### Make the change and test

1. Make changes and check in the browser or live server
1. If possible, test any visual changes in all latest versions of common browsers, on both desktop and mobile
1. Run Prettier or some other code linter and add meaningful, human-readable comments

### Push it

1. `git add -A && git commit -m "My message"` (replacing `My message` with a succinct but meaningful commit message, such as `Fixed card header on iPhone 5SE`) to stage and commit your changes
1. Follow GitHub's instructions on how to push your changes to GitHub, for example with `git push origin my-branch`
1. Go to the [weather-pickmeup repo](https://github.com/stevelab1/weather-pickmeup) and you should see recently pushed branches
1. Follow GitHub's instructions
1. If possible, include screenshots of visual changes. A preview build is triggered after your changes are pushed to GitHub (I will test this after adding index.html and test-deploy to GitHub Pages)

### Suggesting features, improvements, bug fixes

- Consider raising an issue on the [weather-pickmeup issues page](https://github.com/stevelab1/weather-pickmeup/issues). Issues on GitHub are used to track todos, bugs, feature requests, and more.
