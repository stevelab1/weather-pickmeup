### About weather-pickmeup

Have you ever felt down when there's really bad weather outside?
</br>
Or really felt like jumping around and celebrating during summertime?
</br>
This application is an ode to all people with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) out there. We're with you ❤.

### Features

- Pulls in weather from the OpenMeteo API
- Users can search for weather in their desired location and we bring a giphy to cheer them up if the weather is bad or to celebrate with them if the weather is good.
- Users can also choose their favourite animal from a dropdown menu and get an animation related to that mood.
